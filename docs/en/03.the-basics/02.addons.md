## Introduction

The Addons module lists addon packages from PyroCMS and the PyroCMS community as well as any other [configured SATIS repositories](../the-basics/repositories#adding-repositories).

### Support

Viewing an addon reveals supporting resources for users and developers like documentation, user guides, forum topics, websites, etc. 


### Download

Downloading an addon will invoke `composer` to download the addon and it's dependencies as well as update your project's `composer.json` file accordingly.


### Install

After downloading you can install `modules` and `extensions`.

> Seeders are ran when installing via the Control Panel.{.note}
